# Tiny

Almost everything I've learned in my career about how to make things better boils down to one, small truth: Tiny things are more manageable than big things. For me, it started to solidify when I immersed myself in the early "agile" methodologies, specifically Extreme Programming. Small iterations are better iterations. Small methods are better methods. Small teams are better teams. 

Those lessons from XP apply in our daily work as developers, system administrators, designers, and people managers. They even apply in the rest of our lives.

In this talk, I'll try to convince you that keeping things "tiny" is the best thing you can do for yourself and your team.  And, unfortunately it's the opposite of what you're probably going to do instinctively.
