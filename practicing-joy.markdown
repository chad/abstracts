# Practicing Joy

As developers, we understand the need to invest in ourselves to
further our mastery of the craft of software development.
We painstakingly scrutinize our processes.
We polish our tools.
We critique the way we plan and communicate.
We learn new languages and paradigms.
We constantly experiment and improve.

Why do we do this?

It makes us more effective.
When we are more effective, we can create more and better things.
When we create more and better things, we earn money.
When we create more and better things, we earn respect and admiration.

When we are more effective and creative, create more and better
things, and earn more money, respect, and admiration,
we feel happier.

Ultimately, the positive things we do for ourselves serve one purpose:
to facilitate happiness.

What is happiness? What is joy?

What practices lead to both? What tools can we employ to achieve them?
How should we evaluate our progress on the path to happiness?
How do we continuously learn and improve our chances at lasting happiness
and joy?
Why can't we give happiness the same attention we give to our craft?
