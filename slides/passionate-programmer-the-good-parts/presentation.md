That was the _start_ of my career. Since then:

* Independent consulting
* Sold two companies
* CTO
* Conference keynotes
* World travel
* Lead teams large and small
* Rails (Rails Recipes, RailsConf)

* Countless interviews, articles, book contributions, etc.
* Basically, everything

^  Rails community
  Huge conferences
  And drama
  Someone called publicly for my execution
  Crazy client threatened law suit and demanded I be fired
  Death marches
  UNICORN GROWTH
