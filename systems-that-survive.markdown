# Systems That Survive

Large software projects stand a slim chance of ever being finished.
Compared to work created in other fields, the ones that do survive lead very short lives.
It's not uncommon for a building to stand well over a hundred years. Music is still
relevant hundreds of years after it's created.
But as software developers, we're extremely lucky if we create something which doesn't
have to be replaced within five to ten years.
