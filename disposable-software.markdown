# Disposable Components

Large software projects stand a slim chance of ever being finished.
Compared to work created in other fields, the ones that do survive lead very short lives.
It's not uncommon for a building to stand well over a hundred years. Music is still
relevant hundreds of years after it's created.
Even automobiles provide decades of use.
But as software developers, we're extremely lucky if we create something which doesn't
have to be replaced within five to ten years.

How do we as software developers create software that can survive? What can we learn from surviving artifacts in other fields?

This talk will explore the idea that, like living organisms, the key to a long lasting system is that its components are constantly replaced.
